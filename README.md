# AMAZON-SALES-ANALYSIS
I developed an interactive Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard to gain insights into sales performance and customer engagement.

🔹 Analyzed Year-to-Date (YTD) and Quarter-to-Date (QTD) sales performance
🔹 Visualized monthly and weekly sales trends to identify seasonality and demand patterns
🔹 Performed product category analysis to understand revenue contribution and growth areas
🔹 Identified top-performing products based on sales and customer reviews
🔹 Designed dynamic filters for product category and quarter to enable drill-down analysis

📈 This dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions related to sales strategy, inventory planning, and product performance optimization.

Tools Used: Power BI | Excel | Data Visualization | Data Analysis
